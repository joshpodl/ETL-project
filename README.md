# ETL-project

## Proposal:

### Education and housing are closely related in our socio economic life. In this project, we will extract data on those fields from three different resources: Ohio Tax Information, Census API on Social (DP02), Economic(DP03), and Housing(DP04) Characteristics of Ohio (state:39) Counties (88 total), and Greatschools.org. The gathered data will then be cleaned and transformed into a PostgreSQL database.

## Limitations of the project:

### Data are published in 2020 or 2019.

## Resources:

### Ohio Tax Annual Report 2020

### https://api.census.gov/data/2019/acs/acs5/profile/groups.html

### Ohio School districts with city and county name
